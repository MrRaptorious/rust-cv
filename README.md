This is a project to learn the Rust language. I am a beginner at Rust. If you see any problems with my code or know nice Rust Features I could use instead, feel free to let me know!</br>
You could create an Issue and label it enhancement or create a pull request. If you do so, please also add some explanation what the code does differently / how it works and why you would consider it better.
